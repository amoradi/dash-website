Dash has been added to Abra, NegocieCoins, and Bitit in a continuing adoption accumulation.

A popular mobile investing app, Abra formerly only supported Bitcoin and Ethereum on its platform. Recently, however, the service [added 18 additional coins](https://www.coindesk.com/abra-adds-18-cryptocurrencies-to-mobile-wallet/), Dash among them, for trading. The service allows users to add funds via bank transfer, debit card, cash deposit, or Bitcoin, and immediately trade them for many other cryptocurrencies such as Dash.

NegocieCoins expands Dash into Brazilian markets, Bitit increases easy buying options

In addition, Dash was recently added to Brazilian exchange NegocieCoins. The announcement was released earlier this month:

Dash joins a short list of other coins accepted on the platform, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and Litecoin. This adds to the historically limited number of buying options for the Brazilian community, one of Dash's larger and more energetic.

Finally, Bitit recently added Dash to its platform as well:

Unlike traditional exchanges, Bitit offers very fast buying options, with desired currency and exact amount displayed on the front page. The services opens up options to easily buy Dash with 12 different fiat currencies.

During market slumps, integrations keep coming

Despite the cryptocurrency markets dipping back to late November levels, Dash has continued its ecosystem growth unabated. The number of services that have integrated Dash into their platform has grown quickly, with [12 new integrations](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-kicks-off-2018-nearly-20-integrations-partnerships-january-alone/) announced in January alone. Additionally, the Dash Core team announced that it had [filed defensive patents](https://www.dashforcenews.com/dash-kicks-off-2018-nearly-20-integrations-partnerships-january-alone/) for the Evolution platform, and with it released a video of the revolutionary DApp system that is nearing completion. Evolution is scheduled for alpha release in the second half of this year.
