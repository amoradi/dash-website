Hi All,

This is to let you know that our team is going to attend MPE conference in Berlin between 20 and 22 February: <https://www.merchantpaymentsecosystem.com>

Merchant Payments Ecosystem (MPE) is one of the leading European events on merchant payments and one big expo with 3 parallel conferences. We hope to make new connections in the payments industry, promote Dash on European market and present our project to German audience.
Dash presentation and panel discussion takes place at the third day of the conference. We will also have a booth and some marchandise and promo materials to share with visitors.

The team representatives going to Berlin are:
Robert Wiecko @kot
Holger Schinzel @flare
Jan Heinrich Meyer @essra
We will be also supported by Wachsman PR.

Anyone living in Berlin or visiting Berlin during these days, please join us there and help with project promotion :)

Thank you
